[ Introduction ]
    This is a pipeline to process raw fastq data to generate RNA Expression Matrices.
    
[ Data preparation ]
    To use this pipeline, you should provide pair-ended, compressed fastq sequencing files. And you should place each pair of your pair-end compressed fastq files into a fold named with the base name of fastq files.
    For example:
	Sample1/
	Sample1_R1.fastq.gz
	Sample1_R2.fastq.gz
    or:
	Sample2/
	Sample2_1.fq.gz
	Sample2_2.fq.gz

[ Add environment variable ]
    Secondly, export your path of this pipeline directory as RNA_PIPELINE environment variable to you ~/.bashrc file, e.g:
	echo "export RNA_PIPELINE=/path/to/your/pipeline" >> ~/.bashrc
	echo "export PATH=/path/to/your/pipeline:$PATH" >> ~/.bashrc

[ USAGE ]
	Human: scRNA_work -h -u [Username] [OPTIONS]
	Mouse: scRNA_work -m -u [Username] [OPTIONS]

[ OPTIONS ]
	--help		Show help documentation.
	-h,--human	Set the species to human. Reads will be mapped to GRCh38 reference genome.
	-l,--list [Name of list]	Set tha name of sample list, default is sample.xls.
	-m,--mouse	Set the species to mouse. Reads will be mapped to mm10 reference genome.
	-n,--nMaxMultimap [int]	Set the max multimapping threshold. Defalt 1 in human; 5 in mouse.
	-p,--partition	[cn-long/cn-short/cn_nl]	Set the partition you run this pipeline. Default is cn-long. You can choose partition depending on your file system.
	Details:
	-------------------------------------------
	PARTITION	|	FILE SYSTEM
	cn-long		|	lustre1/2/3 gpfs1/2
	cn-short	|	lustre1/2/3
	cn_nl		|	lustre2/3
	-------------------------------------------
	-u,--user [Username]	Set the user name. (Necessary)

[ CONFIGURATION ]
	If you want to change the database and softwares used in this pipeline, modifiy the configuration file human_config or mouse_config in the pipeline directory.
